## Changelog

**2021-12-09:**
- Remove dependency on Java and Stanford CoreNLP (changed into Python native package 'Stanza').

**2020-08-14:**
- The Docker image now inherits from a CUDA-enabled base image.
- Clarified memory and dataset requirements on the image.
- Fixed the issue where token IDs were not converted to word-piece IDs for BERT value linking.  

## Usage

### Step 1: Download third-party datasets & dependencies

Download the datasets: [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) and [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL). In case of Spider, make sure to download the `08/03/2020` version or newer.
Unpack the datasets somewhere outside this project to create the following directory structure:
```
/path/to/data
├── spider
│   ├── database
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── dev.json
│   ├── dev_gold.sql
│   ├── tables.json
│   ├── train_gold.sql
│   ├── train_others.json
│   └── train_spider.json
└── wikisql
    ├── dev.db
    ├── dev.jsonl
    ├── dev.tables.jsonl
    ├── test.db
    ├── test.jsonl
    ├── test.tables.jsonl
    ├── train.db
    ├── train.jsonl
    └── train.tables.jsonl
```

To work with the WikiSQL dataset, clone its evaluation scripts into this project:
``` bash
mkdir -p third_party
git clone https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL third_party/wikisql
```

### Step 2: Build and run the Docker image

We have provided a `Dockerfile` that sets up the entire environment for you.
It assumes that you mount the datasets downloaded in Step 1 as a volume `/mnt/data` into a running image.
Thus, the environment setup for RAT-SQL is:
``` bash
docker build -t ratsql .
docker run --rm -m4g -v /path/to/data:/mnt/data -it ratsql
```
Note that the image requires at least 4 GB of RAM to run preprocessing.
By default, [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) and [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) run containers with 2 GB of RAM.
The `-m4g` switch overrides it; alternatively, you can increase the default limit in the Docker Desktop settings.

> If you prefer to set up and run the codebase without Docker, follow the steps in `Dockerfile` one by one.
> Note that this repository requires Python 3.7 or higher.

### Step 3: Run the experiments

Every experiment has its own config file in `experiments`.
The pipeline of working with any model version or dataset is: 

``` bash
python run.py preprocess experiment_config_file  # Step 3a: preprocess the data
python run.py train experiment_config_file       # Step 3b: train a model
python run.py eval experiment_config_file        # Step 3b: evaluate the results
```

Use the following experiment config files to reproduce our results:

* Spider, GloVE version: `experiments/spider-glove-run.jsonnet`
* Spider, BERT version (requires a GPU with at least 16GB memory): `experiments/spider-bert-run.jsonnet`
* WikiSQL, GloVE version: `experiments/wikisql-glove-run.jsonnet`

The exact model accuracy may vary by ±2% depending on a random seed. See [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04942) for details.
